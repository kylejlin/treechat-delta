# Treechat

A tree-structured chatting web app, built with React and Firebase.

## NOTE:

**THIS REPOSITORY IS ARCHIVED. THE PROVIDED DEMO LINKS MAY NO LONGER WORK.**

## Tree-like comment organization

As opposed to traditional linear comment-organization, Treechat uses a tree-like structure. That is, in most messaging systems, every node (comment) is a child (reply) of the previous (most recently created) node. In Treechat, every node can be a child of any other node, instead of just the previous one.

## Platforms

Officially, only iOS and Android phones are currently supported. Since this is a web app, you can use it in any browser on any device, but it might not fit your viewport very well.
